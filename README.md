This project was created for Professor R. Davila's MATH 2305 Summer Class

This project was written in python using the Spyder IDE.

The purpose of this project is to create and analyze weighted graphs using Prim's algorithm.

To get started, create a new project in your favorite python IDE and load the repository.
Use uhd_weighted_graphs.py to run the code.
You may also use test.py to test new code.
If you wish, you may add new graphs to the data folder.

This project is contributed to and maintained by Nick Delmedico.
